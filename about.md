Hello! My name is Christian Barth Roligheten and I am a computer science student at NTNU in Norway.

I am currently pursuing computer science as a career however I have a deep interest in technology outside of university.

<br>

 I have worked on various projects throughout the years, doing everything from embedded projects such as a [GPS transmitter for sounding rockets](https://github.com/Catuna/SoundingRocketGPS), to helping build one of Norway's biggest [classified sites for books](https://ibok.no/). I am also 3D-printer hobbyist who owns a WANHAU Duplicator i3 which I use exclusively for making useless junk.

 For a better overview of my professional and personal work in technology check me out in the links in the footer of this page.
